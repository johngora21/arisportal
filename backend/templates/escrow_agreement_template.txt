TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
---------------------

1. ESCROW PURPOSE AND SMART CONTRACT SECURITY
   This escrow agreement is established to hold funds for the following transaction:
   {DESCRIPTION}
   
   All funds will be secured in a blockchain smart contract that enforces the 
   terms of this agreement automatically. The smart contract provides:
   - Cryptographic security for all deposited funds
   - Automatic execution of terms without third-party intervention
   - Transparent and auditable transaction history
   - Protection against fraud or unauthorized withdrawals

2. BLOCKCHAIN DEPOSIT OF FUNDS
   The Payer agrees to deposit the total amount of {TOTAL_AMOUNT} TZS into the 
   blockchain smart contract escrow account. Funds will be held in a secure, 
   decentralized smart contract address that is publicly verifiable on the 
   blockchain. The smart contract ensures that:
   - Funds cannot be withdrawn without meeting release conditions
   - Both parties can verify the escrow balance at any time
   - Transaction history is permanently recorded on blockchain
   - Funds are protected by cryptographic security mechanisms

3. AUTOMATIC FUNDS RELEASE VIA SMART CONTRACT
   The blockchain smart contract will automatically release funds to the Payee 
   upon fulfillment of the following conditions:
   - Completion of all agreed upon deliverables/services
   - Verification of successful transaction
   - Release authorization by Payer or automatic release on {RELEASE_DATE}
   - For milestone-based payments: Completion of specific milestones as verified
   
   The smart contract automatically executes payment releases based on:
   - Pre-programmed conditions encoded in the contract
   - Digital signatures from authorized parties
   - Time-based release triggers (if applicable)
   - Milestone completion verification (if applicable)
   
   Once conditions are met, the smart contract executes the payment transfer 
   automatically without requiring manual intervention.

4. SMART CONTRACT DISPUTE RESOLUTION
   The blockchain smart contract includes built-in dispute resolution mechanisms:
   - Smart contract enters "disputed" state, freezing all automatic releases
   - Both parties must cooperate in good faith to resolve the matter
   - ArisPortal may mediate and execute resolution through smart contract
   - Funds remain locked in smart contract until dispute is resolved
   - If no resolution within 30 days, smart contract may execute refund to Payer
   - Dispute resolution is recorded on blockchain for transparency
   - All parties can verify dispute status by viewing smart contract state

5. AUTOMATIC REFUND POLICY VIA SMART CONTRACT
   The blockchain smart contract can automatically execute refunds to the Payer if:
   - The transaction is cancelled by both parties
   - The Payee fails to meet agreed conditions
   - A valid dispute is resolved in favor of the Payer
   - Milestone deadlines are not met (for milestone-based payments)
   - As otherwise programmed in the smart contract
   
   All refunds are executed automatically by the smart contract and recorded 
   on the blockchain with complete transparency. The smart contract ensures 
   refunds cannot be reversed and provides immutable proof of the transaction.

6. BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK FEES
   Escrow service fees will be deducted from the release amount as per ArisPortal's 
   fee structure. Both parties acknowledge and agree to these fees.
   
   Additionally, blockchain network transaction fees may apply for:
   - Deposit of funds into smart contract
   - Release of funds from smart contract
   - Dispute resolution transactions
   - Network confirmation costs
   
   These fees are minimal and ensure the security and immutability of the escrow 
   transaction on the blockchain.

7. SMART CONTRACT SECURITY AND LIABILITY
   The smart contract provides cryptographic security for all escrowed funds.
   ArisPortal acts as the smart contract operator and is not liable for:
   - The quality, merchantability, or fitness of goods/services
   - Any disputes between Payer and Payee
   - Any losses incurred by either party beyond the escrowed amount
   - Blockchain network failures or congestion (funds remain secure)
   - Smart contract bugs or vulnerabilities in the underlying blockchain
   
   However, the smart contract code has been audited and designed with security 
   best practices to minimize risks. All escrow operations are transparent and 
   verifiable on the blockchain.

8. BLOCKCHAIN JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW
   While the escrow funds are secured on a decentralized blockchain network, 
   this agreement is governed by the laws of Tanzania. Any disputes arising from 
   this agreement shall be resolved through arbitration in accordance with 
   Tanzanian law.
   
   The smart contract's execution on the blockchain does not supersede applicable 
   local laws and regulations. Both parties agree that:
   - Tanzanian courts have jurisdiction over this agreement
   - Smart contract addresses and transactions may be provided as evidence
   - Blockchain records are acceptable as legally binding proof of transactions
